# FirstMinecraftMod
This is my first minecraft mod, created to help me learn how to add items and blocks to the game. It features using base items and blocks, and only using one texture for all the variants. To achieve different colors, metadata and tintindex is used, allowing multiple versions while saving on space and reducing code duplication. This is a method not commonly found, especially using only one texture.

# Features
It adds a new ore, gem item, and gem block, each with six different colored variants.
It adds a custom creative tab.
The ores generate naturally in the world, allowing this to interface with survival games.
